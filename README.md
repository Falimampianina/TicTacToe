# TicTacToe
This is a simple TicTacToe game i use to code
A player can be human or computer (with three different level: easy , medium or hard)
To beginn, the user have to input : start <player> <player>: he can choose if he wants to play or watch computer play
I got this project from Hyperskill which is an online learning plattform that gives the student tasks to implement, and this is one of those.
